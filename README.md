## Visit Web Application

This project is currently hosted on netlify and doesn't any extra steps to test it out. Visit the site [here](https://mint-nft-simulation.netlify.app)

## Video Demo

I have created a short clip to show you what the application is like. Please see here on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5KHybBLw9D4)

## Application Design Choices

For this application, the design choices where simple since it is a simulation. HTML was used to structure each page, CSS was used to make them visually appealing and JavaScript was used for the interaction along with the LocalStorage API to persist the data.

NOTE: The array stored in the LocalStorage API was stringified to allow storage. Ideally, localStorage doesn't store arrays but strings.

## Requirements

The application doesn't have any bundlers. The only requirements are:

- A text editor like VS Code
- A simple live server to load the `index.html` page. You can download the VS Code [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

## Getting Started

All you have to do to get started is clone the application:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Martinsngene/mint-nft-simulation.git

```
